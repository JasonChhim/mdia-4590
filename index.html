    <h3>Environments</h3>
    <p>One way of organizing our code is to mimic the different environments for our project. For example, we may have one environment for developers, one for testing and collaboration, and one for the live site. In this case, we would habe three branches as well. You may chose to call them develoment, staging, and masters.</p>

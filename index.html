    <h2>Branches</h2>
    <p>Next we will learn about branches. they help us work on new code without jeopardizing the intgrity of the main codebase.</p>

    <h3>Environments</h3>
    <p>One way of organizing our code is to mimic the different environments for our project. For example, we may have one environment for developers, one for testing and collaboration, and one for the live site. In this case, we would habe three branches as well. You may chose to call them develoment, staging, and masters.</p>
    <h2>Merging</h2>
    <p>Beware! If there is a change one file and the same line is changed on another, the code cannot be automatically merged. This will result in a merge conflict. You may need to resolve this manually or with the assistance of additional software. Good luck!</p>
